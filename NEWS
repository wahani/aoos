Version 0.3.5
- %m% now supports 'type expressions', i.e. the signature is expressed as
'varName ~ typeName'. Using '=' for specifying the signature is not supported
anymore.

Version 0.3.4
- The class Show is not a reference class anymore but an ordinary S4 class. This
should not make a difference since it is virtual.

Version 0.3.3
- Linking the interfaces to the S4 class system to the roxygen2 documentation
facilities. It is now possible to document generics, methods and types in the
same way as you would using only the methods package.
- New functions parser_%m%, parser_%g% and parser_%type% to be used by roxygen2

Version 0.3.2
- New wrapper around setClass: %types% to be used as a subset of S4 classes. It
mimics the pattern of "setClass(...); setMethod("initialize", ...)" and captures
most of the needed features.

Version 0.3.1
- New wrappers (%g% and %m%) around setGeneric and setMethod from the methods
package. They provide an alternative approach to define (S4) generic functions
and methods putting an emphasis on readability.

Version 0.3.0
- CRAN release

Version 0.2.6
- Renaming Class -> defineRefClass

Version 0.2.5
- retList: renamed argument 'exports' to 'public'.
- Possible to define encapsulated unary operators.
- Vignette on classes with reList.
- Vignette on performance.

Version 0.2.4
- retList has now an object called .self referring to itself.

Version 0.2.3
- retList can now 'inherit' from another list. An extra argument superEnv can be
used to really extend a class definition in this framework.
- retList has new arguments to control inheritance. 

Version 0.2.2
- New classes Infix and Print which enable encapsulated definitions of infix
operators and print methods for S3 classes.

Version 0.2.1
- New functions retList and funNames to work with closures as objects

Version 0.2.0

- CRAN release

Version 0.1.6
- New class 'Binary' to add binary operators to aoos classes

Version 0.1.5
- Bugfix when calling new/constructor without arguments
- Inheritance of non-aoos classes - for S4 Method dispatch
- update to summary method for aoos
- New class 'Show' to easily override default show method for aoos classes
- New class 'Accessor' to override the default accessor for aoos classes

Version 0.1.4
- Bugfix in Class when constructing refClass with empty fields
- Updated behaviour of aoos classes. Leading '.' indicates a private member, all
other names refer to public member
- New function private to declare a member to be private regardless of name
- Initialise method for aoos classes now properly passes arguments to init, so
new can be used for initialisation
- Updated vignettes

Version 0.1.3
- New class 'Private' to add restricted access to methods and fields of
reference classes

Version 0.1.2
- New function Class, which is a wrapper around setRefClass

Version 0.1.1

- Bugfix when accessing reference objects.

Version 0.1.0

- CRAN release

Version 0.0.6

- Handling of fields inheriting from 'environment'

Version 0.0.5

- Use the method public instead of publicFunction and publicValue
- Renaming of class oom to aoos
- Vignette: Introduction

Version 0.0.4

- Can define function 'init' which will be called if arguments are supplied to
the constructor.
- defineClass has new side effect: S4 method for 'initialize'
- defineClass lost side effect: constructor is not assigned to the class-name
- Constructor functions can be named differnet from the class-name
- S4-constructor 'new' can be used to create a new object

Version 0.0.3

- Access self inside class definitions also for private objects.

Version 0.0.2

- Inheritance: Replacing members of parent is possible.
- Fix in package-tests, as there are some problems on CRAN.
- class oom is now VIRTUAL.
- summary method for oom.
- modified show method.
