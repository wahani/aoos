## Examples:

### retList:

Basically you define constructor functions. There is no *formal* class definition. The function body will define what members an object will have. You quit the function defining the return value using `retList` which is a *generic* constructor function. By default it will look at the environment from which it is called and convert that environment into a list. That list is returned and is an object. Names with a "." are not part of the constructed *list* (by default).

```{r}
library("aoos")
Employee <- function(.name, .salary) {
  "Common base class for all employees"
  
  print <- function(x, ...) {
    cat("Name  : ", .self$.name, "\nSalary: ", .self$.salary)
  }
  
  getName <- function() .name
  getSalary <- function() .self$.salary
  
  retList(c("Employee", "Print"))
  
}

peter <- Employee("Peter", 5)
peter
peter$getName()
peter$getSalary()
```

Here every instance is of class *Employee* and also inherits from class *Print*. This enables us to define the print method in the functions body and is equivalent to invoking the print method directly:

```{r}
peter
peter$print()
```


### retList + Inheritance:

You can inherit methods and fields from a super class, or rather an instance, because there is no *formal* calls definition. Methods and fields can be replaced in the child, all member from the parent are also available for the methods of the child.

```{r}
Manager <- function(.name, .salary, .bonus) {
  "Extending the Employee class"
  
  bonus <- function(x) {
    if (!missing(x)) .self$.bonus <- x
    .self$.bonus
  }
  
  print <- function(x, ...) {
    cat("Name  : ", .self$.name, "\nSalary: ", .self$.salary, 
        "\nBonus:", .self$.bonus)
  }
  
  retList("Manager", super = Employee(.name, .salary))
  
}

julia <- Manager("Julia", 5, 5 * 1e6)
julia
julia$getSalary()
julia$bonus(10)
julia
```

### retList + S4 generics

As of version 0.3.1 there exist two binary operators, `%g%` and `%m%`, which link to the S4 system for genric functions. They provide (hopefully) concise alternatives to `methods::setGeneric` and `methods::setMethod`:

```{r}
# Standard definition for a generic without default:
strLength(x = 2, ...) %g% standardGeneric("strLength")

# A method for x:character
strLength(x = character, ...) %m% { nchar(x) }

# Kind of the default method for x:ANY
strLength(x = ANY, ...) %m% { strLength(as.character(x)) }

# Check that it works:
strLength(123)
strLength("ab")
```

A bit tricky and unwise is that the generic has a default value of 2 which means that as long the ANY-method is not defined the default is not working, but I needed to illustrate default values. In S4, methods can have defaults for arguments which are not formals of the generic. Otherwise the defaults of the generic are passed down to its methods. This is not changed: Define defaults for the generic. If a method has more arguments than its generic you can define defaults for them. For the *shared* argument names provide a class name. One exception to the rule are `...` on which S4 cannot dispatch.

```{r}
strLength()
```

An important difference to `methods::setGeneric` and `methods::setMethod` is that methods and generics are stored in the environment where they are created and not in the top environment. That means you can define generics which are local to a function or closure and this extends the `retList`-idea of representing objects in *R* as demonstrated here:

```{r}
Class <- function() {
  
  overloaded(x) %g% { 
    cat("This is the default ... \n")
    x 
  } 
  
  overloaded(x = numeric) %m% {
    cat("This is the method for 'numeric' values ... \n")
    x
  }
  
  retList("Class")
}

instance <- Class()
instance$overloaded(1)
instance$overloaded("a")
```

The next question is how to inherit or extend an existing generic which is a member of a class? I am not entirely happy with how this works at the moment, but this is one way to approach it (which works...):

```{r}
Child <- function() {
  
  # Normally you would make the call to the parents constructor in the call
  # to retList. But here we need to access the elements directly during init...
  .super <- Class()
  
  # This points %m% to the generic (in .super) which should be extended:
  .super$overloaded(x = integer) %m% {
    cat("This is the method for 'integer' values ... \n")
    x
  }
  
  retList("Child", super = .super)
  
}

instance <- Child()
instance$overloaded(1)
instance$overloaded("a")
instance$overloaded(1L)
```

### S4 Types

The following presents the function `%type%` which is a link to S4s `setClass`. When using `setClass` in many scenarios redundancy (of information) in the code is introduced. `%type%` tries to abstract a typical scenario of using `setClass`. Here is an example, first the S4 approach which is usefull in a scenario where inheritance is relevant. `.Object <- callNextMethod()` is important so that all init-methods are called. The prototype is usefull to have default values on init:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Test <- setClass("Test", 
                 slots = list(x = "numeric", y = "list"),
                 prototype = list(x = 1, y = list()))

setMethod("initialize", 
          "Test", 
          function(.Object, ...) {
            .Object <- callNextMethod()
            stopifnot(.Object@x > 0)
            .Object
          })

Child <- setClass("Child", contains = "Test",
                  slots = c(z = "character"),
                  prototype = list(z = " "))

setMethod("initialize", 
          "Child", 
          function(.Object, ...) {
            .Object <- callNextMethod()
            stopifnot(nchar(.Object@z) > 0)
            .Object
          })

Test() # works
# If you want to have something else than '...', e.g. named arguments you have 
# to define 'Test' yourself:
Test(2) # won't work.
Test(x = 2) # works
Child() # has 3 slots with defaults as in the prototype
```

Looking at the source code it is hard to see how many slots are involved and what exactly is going on with these two classes. It just looks complicated. The next snippet does more or less the same thing:

```{r results='hide'}
Test(x = 1, y = list()) %type% {
  stopifnot(.Object@x > 0)
  .Object
}

Test : Child(z = " ") %type% {
  stopifnot(nchar(.Object@z) > 0)
  .Object
}

Test() # works
Test(2) # works
Test(x = 2) # works
Child("Hej", x = 2) # works: Child <- function(z, ...) new('Child', z = z, ...)
```

Three things are happening on a call to `%type%`. `setClass` is called with prototype and slots derived from the prototype. `setMethod` for `initialize` with `.Object` and `...` as arguments; and `.Object <- callNextMethod()` as first line so that init allways works correct; and the rhs expression as body. And finally a constructor function is assigned to the types name (with arguments and defaults).

### More on `retList`

Something you have to keep in mind is that returned objects are of class *list*. If you want to have a public field you have to define get and set methods, because you will see a copy of those fields in the object, they behave more like an attribute.

```{r}
ObjectWithField <- function(name) {
  getName <- function() {
    name
  }
  retList()
} 

obj <- ObjectWithField("Alexander")
obj$name <- "Noah"
obj$getName()
obj$name
```

We can do more abstract representations of *things*. In this example I want to create a constructor object which keeps track of how many instances it created. Also every instance should know how many siblings it has, or in other words all instances share a reference to a field accessible by all of them.

```{r}
initFamily <- function(.familyName) {
  
  .superEnv <- environment()
  .count <- 0
  
  getCount <- function() {
    cat("There are", .self$.count, paste0(.familyName, "s"), "out there.")
  }
  
  new <- function(.name) {
    # happens on init
    .count <<- .count + 1
    
    print <- function(x, ...) cat("My name is", .self$.name, .familyName, "!")
    countSiblings <- function() cat("I have", .count, "siblings!")
    
    # So every instance knows about .count and .familyName:
    retList(c("Person", "Print"), superEnv = new.env(parent = .superEnv))
  }
  
  retList("ConstructorPerson")
  
}

schmidt <- initFamily("Schmidt")
schmidt$getCount()
lisa <- schmidt$new("Lisa")

sandra <- schmidt$new("Sandra")
schmidt$getCount()
sandra$countSiblings()
sandra
lisa
```
